# Cross-Platform Cloud & DevOps Glossary (AWS, GCP, Azure) — Enhanced 

>Below is an enhanced (but still aiming to stay compact), side-by-side glossary of key cloud components and technologies across **AWS**, **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**, and **Microsoft Azure**. Emphasis on DevOps-related services and equivalents. Where a component is absent, that is noted.

## How Content is Organized

- Information on this page is grouped by common cloud platform categories: **Compute**, **Storage**, **Networking**, **IAM**, **DevOps/CI·CD**, **Containers**, **Serverless**, **Databases**, **Monitoring & Logging**, **Infrastructure as Code**, **Security & Secrets**, **Messaging & Eventing**, **CDN & Edge**, **Machine Learning**, **Cost & Governance**.
- Each category lists the main components/service(s) of **AWS**, **GCP**, and **Azure**, with descriptions and notable differences.

(Could end up being useful as a reference or translation table when moving architectures or writing runbooks.)

## Comparative Notes & Observations (DevOps-focused)

- **CI/CD & DevOps tool parity:** All three clouds offer pipeline/orchestration, build, and deployment services. Azure DevOps and GitHub Actions are particularly feature-rich for pipelines; GCP's Cloud Build and Cloud Deploy are improving quickly; AWS Code* tools are feature-complete but often seen as more tightly coupled to AWS.
- **IaC reality:** Terraform is the de-facto standard in multi-cloud organizations. Native templates (CloudFormation, ARM/Bicep, Deployment Manager) are used for deep cloud-specific automation or where an organisation prefers a single-cloud native solution.
- **Secret & identity management:** Each cloud has secrets and key management; Azure AD is the dominant identity provider for enterprise Windows shops while AWS IAM remains resource-centric and flexible for service roles.
- **Managed Kubernetes:** GKE is often praised for reliability and upstream alignment; EKS is the AWS choice with strong integrations; AKS simplifies Azure authentication and Developer Experience for Microsoft stacks.
- **Where features are missing:**

    - **Feature flags:** No first-party feature flagging solution is universally available — clouds provide config rollout tools (AppConfig, App Configuration) but teams often use third-party feature-flag services (LaunchDarkly, Flagsmith).
    - **Managed full-service service mesh:** While all clouds support service mesh tooling, a universal, fully-managed Istio-like control plane is not equally available as a single turnkey service to all customers. Anthos (GCP) and App Mesh (AWS) offer pieces but require setup/management.

## Quick Reference: Common DevOps Equivalents

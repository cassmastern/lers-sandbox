# Diagram Accessibility: Current State/Path Forward

>Another sticky note; I have now built a more-or-less robust doc platform with live diagram rendering, theme switching, and accessibility patching for **Mermaid**. But **PlantUML** and **Graphviz** still lag behind in accessibility and dynamic responsiveness.

## Mermaid: Fully Live, Fully Accessible

Mermaid diagrams are rendered client-side using JavaScript. My `seamaiden.js` handles theme switching, and `svg-patcher.js` injects accessibility metadata (`role="img"`, `tabindex="0"`, etc.) after rendering.

### Mermaid Rendering Workflow

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  A[Markdown with Mermaid block] --> B[Mermaid JS renders SVG in browser]
  B --> C[Theme switch triggers re-render]
  C --> D[Accessibility patcher injects metadata]
  D --> E[Diagram becomes keyboard-accessible and WCAG-compliant]
```

This flow is modular, responsive, and editorially controlled.

## PlantUML: Static, Theme-Aware, But Not Accessible

PlantUML diagrams are rendered server-side or at build-time via `mkdocs_puml`. The plugin supports dual rendering for light and dark themes, but SVGs lack accessibility metadata unless manually patched.

### PlantUML Rendering Workflow

```kroki-plantuml
@startuml
title PlantUML Rendering Workflow

rectangle "Markdown with PlantUML block" as A
rectangle "mkdocs_puml plugin" as B
rectangle "SVG (light + dark)" as C
rectangle "No accessibility metadata" as D
rectangle "Optional Python patcher" as E

A --> B
B --> C
C --> D
D --> E : Inject role='img', title, desc, tabindex
@enduml
```

To match Mermaid’s accessibility, I'll need a Python-based SVG patcher that runs post-build.

## Graphviz: Powerful, But Accessibility-Agnostic

Graphviz (DOT language) is rendered at build-time into static SVGs. It’s great for dependency graphs and provenance maps, but:

- No theme responsiveness
- No accessibility metadata
- No live preview

To integrate Graphviz cleanly:
- I could use `mkdocs-diagrams` — for unified rendering
- Pre-render `.dot` files to SVG
- Inject accessibility metadata via Python patcher
- Wrap diagrams in `<figure>` blocks with captions and changelog tags

## Rough Plan to Extend Full Support

### 1. **PlantUML Accessibility**
- Write a Python patcher to inject `<title>`, `<desc>`, `role="img"`, and `tabindex="0"` into SVGs
- Run it post-build or in CI/CD pipeline
- Optionally tag diagrams with `data-provenance` and changelog metadata

### 2. **Graphviz Integration**
- Use `mkdocs-diagrams` to unify rendering
- Pre-render `.dot` files to SVG
- Apply same Python patcher for accessibility
- Wrap diagrams in `<figure>` blocks with captions and editorial context

### 3. **Registry and Provenance**
- Create a diagram registry with filenames, changelog tags, and accessibility status
- Use `aria-describedby` to link diagrams to hidden editorial notes
- Ensure all diagrams are keyboard-accessible and theme-aware

### 4. Bonus — draw.io?

With this flow, I might end up having full editorial control, accessibility compliance, and modular rendering across all diagram formats — without brittle plugins or runtime flicker.

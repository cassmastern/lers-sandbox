## Key Takeaways

Essential aspects of SMART-on-FHIR:

### Core Concepts

1. **SMART-on-FHIR** combines OAuth 2.0 authorization with FHIR REST APIs to enable secure app integration with EHR systems
2. **FHIR Resources** are the building blocks:
   * **Patient** : Demographics and administrative data
   * **Observation** : Clinical measurements and findings
   * **Condition** : Diagnoses and problems
   * **MedicationRequest** : Prescriptions and orders
   * **Encounter** : Healthcare interactions
   * And many more interconnected resources
3. **Authorization Flow** :
   * Launch → Authorization → Token Exchange → API Access
   * Scopes control access granularity (patient/Resource.read)
   * Context provides patient/encounter information
4. **FHIR Search** is powerful:
   * Parameter-based queries
   * Chaining and reverse chaining
   * Include/revinclude for related resources
   * Pagination for large result sets

### Practical Implementation

The interactive React application demonstrates:

* Connecting to the SMART Health IT sandbox
* Retrieving various resource types
* Displaying clinical data in user-friendly format
* Handling errors gracefully

### Best Practices

* Always validate resources before submission
* Implement proper error handling for 401/403/404 responses
* Use refresh tokens for long-running sessions
* Cache capability statements
* Log OAuth flow for debugging
* Test with multiple patient scenarios
* Follow US Core or relevant implementation guides

### Resources for Further Learning

* SMART App Launch:[http://hl7.org/fhir/smart-app-launch/](http://hl7.org/fhir/smart-app-launch/)
* FHIR R4 Specification:[http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/)
* US Core Implementation Guide:[http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/)
* SMART Health IT Sandbox:[https://launch.smarthealthit.org](https://launch.smarthealthit.org)

Code examples (JavaScript and Python) and the interactive application should serve as a foundation to start building SMART-on-FHIR applications that integrate with healthcare systems.

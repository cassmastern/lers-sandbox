Welcome to Ler's Sandbox!

The site's purpose is multifold:

- to brush up and deepen my knowledge of GitHub, MkDocs, major cloud platforms, Markdown, content architecture, networking, and more 
- to play with some of the features supporting accessibility and eventually implement full WCAG compliance
- to build up a technical documentation site for demo purposes
- to discover new *'domain curiosities'*

> **Note:** This site is in constant 'work-in-progress' mode — expect rough edges; they’re part of the showcase.

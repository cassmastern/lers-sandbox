Welcome to Ler's Sandbox!

The site's purpose is multifold:

- to build up a feature-rich technical documentation system and infrastructure for my own use and for demo purposes ([see repo's readme](https://github.com/cassmastern/lers-sandbox/blob/main/readme.md))
- to use that very infrastructure, populating it with content that will hopefully brush up and deepen my knowledge of GitHub, MkDocs, major cloud platforms, Markdown, content architecture, networking, and more
- to play with some of the features supporting accessibility and eventually implement full WCAG compliance
- to discover new *'domain curiosities'*

> **Note:** This site is in constant 'work-in-progress' mode — expect rough edges; they’re part of the showcase.

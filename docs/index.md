Welcome to Ler's Sandbox!

The site's purpose is multifold:

- to build up a feature-rich technical documentation system and infrastructure for my own use and for demo purposes ([see repo's readme](https://github.com/cassmastern/lers-sandbox/blob/main/readme.md))
- to make use of that very system and infrastructure — populate it with content, covering my domain curiosities, that will hopefully remain relevant and useful for my own use
- to discover new domain curiosities

!!! note "Note"
    This site is in constant 'work-in-progress' mode — expect rough edges; they’re part of the showcase.

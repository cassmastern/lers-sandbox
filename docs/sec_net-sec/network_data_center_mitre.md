# Network Security and Threat Modeling — MITRE ATT&CK

## Why It Matters

MITRE ATT&CK is a globally recognized framework that catalogs real-world adversary behaviors. Mapping ATT&CK techniques to our architecture helps anticipate attacker tactics and improve detection, response, and resilience.

## ATT&CK-Based Threat Modeling

This section applies MITRE ATT&CK techniques to our hypothetical data centre network, highlighting how adversaries might target specific components and how defenders can respond.

## Defensive Enhancements

To strengthen defenses, consider the following enhancements aligned with ATT&CK-informed detection and response strategies.

* **SIEM Enrichment**: Map logs to ATT&CK techniques for faster triage.
* **Threat Detection Rules**: Use Sigma or MITRE D3FEND to write detection logic.
* **Red Team Scenarios**: Simulate TTPs like T1078 (Valid Accounts) or T1190 (Exploit Public-Facing App).
* **Purple Teaming**: Validate defenses by emulating known adversary behavior (e.g. APT29, FIN7).

# About this Website

In August 2025, I revived an old MkDocs-based glossary project and reimagined it as a modular, containerized website, an all-in-one playground, demo, and concept repository.

This section contains information about the *content* on this site:

- [What's in Here?](whatsinhere.md)
- [Roadmap & Changelog](roadmap.md)
- [Feedback](feedback.md)

For information about the system and the infrastructure behind the site, see the [repo's readme](https://github.com/cassmastern/lers-sandbox/blob/main/readme.md).

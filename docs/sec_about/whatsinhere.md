# What's in Here?

This site covers, in a variety of formats, fields I'm interested in, including accessibility (AODA/WCAG), AI, APIs, CI/CD, business analysis, cloud platforms, networking and security, content/knowledge/information architecture, eHealth, Git, and markdown.

No (or very little) late-night easy reading here.

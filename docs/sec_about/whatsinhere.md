# What's in Here?

This site contains topics, writing samples, glossaries, cheat sheets, concepets and ideas — designed to remain relevant and useful for my own use and future endeavors, and cover fields I'm interested in, including cloud platforms, CI/CD, accessibility (AODA/WCAG), eHealth, AI, APIs, and computer networking.

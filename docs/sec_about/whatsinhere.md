# What's in Here?

This site contains topics, writing samples, glossaries, cheat sheets, concepets and ideas â€” designed to remain relevant and useful for my own use and future endeavors, and cover fields I'm interested in, including cloud platforms, CI/CD, accessibility (AODA/WCAG), eHealth, AI, and computer networking. 

Topics are grouped into these sections:

- [About this Website](../sec_about/index.md)  
- [In the Clouds](../sec_cloud/index.md)  
- [Accessibility](../sec_accss/index.md)  
- [Enterprise Networks and Security](../sec_net-sec/index.md)  
- [Concepts, Ideas, and Free-Form Articles](../sec_freeform/index.md)
- [eHealth](../sec_ehealth/index.md)  
- [Miscellaneous Cheat Sheets](../sec_cheatsheets/index.md)  
- [Miscellaneous Glossaries](../sec_gloss/index.md)  

No (or very little) late-night easy reading here.
